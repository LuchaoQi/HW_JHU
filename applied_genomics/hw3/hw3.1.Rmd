### Q1a.  

We need $5*10^4$ 100bp reads.  

\begin{align*}
    n*100bp &= 1Mbp * 5\\
    n &= \frac{5*10^6}{10^2} \\
    n &=5*10^4 
\end{align*}  

\pagebreak  

### Q1b.  

Use following R code to simulate 5x coverage of a 1Mbp genome:  
```{r}

set.seed(100)
s = 1000000
n = 5
a = sample(1:s, n*s,replace=TRUE)
coverage = rep(0,s)
for (i in a ){coverage[i] = coverage[i]+1}
hist(coverage,prob=T,col="light blue")
xfit<-seq(min(coverage),max(coverage))
yfit<-dpois(xfit,n)
lines(xfit,yfit,col="red",lwd=3)

length(which(coverage==0))
mean(coverage)
```

\pagebreak

### Q1c.  

From the results shown in Q1b, 6871 bases have not been sequenced. Theoretically, the Poisson expecation should be the value of coverage:5, which equals to exactly the mean of our simulations. 

\pagebreak

### Q1d.  

Use following R code to simulate 15x coverage:  

```{r}
set.seed(100)
s = 1000000
n = 15
a = sample(1:s, n*s,replace=TRUE)
coverage = rep(0,s)
for (i in a ){coverage[i] = coverage[i]+1}
hist(coverage,prob=T,col="light blue")
xfit<-seq(min(coverage),max(coverage))
yfit<-dpois(xfit,n)
lines(xfit,yfit,col="red",lwd=3)

length(which(coverage==0))
mean(coverage)
```

From the results shown above, 1 base has not been sequenced.Theoretically, the Poisson expecation should be the value of coverage: 15, which equals to exactly the mean of our simulations.

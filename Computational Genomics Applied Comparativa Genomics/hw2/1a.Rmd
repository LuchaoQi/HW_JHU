#### Question 1. Coverage Analysis [20 pts]

Download the reads and reference genome from: https://github.com/schatzlab/appliedgenomics2019/raw/master/assignments/assignment2/asm.tgz

Note I have provided both paired-end and mate-pairs reads (see included README for details). 
Make sure to look at all of the reads for the coverage analysis and kmer analysis, as well as in the assembly.

- Question 1a. How long is the reference genome? [Hint: Try `samtools faidx`]

> After trying the following command:  
samtools faidx ref.fa  
we could get a file with .fai extension.

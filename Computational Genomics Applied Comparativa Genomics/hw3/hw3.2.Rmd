### Q3a.  

Through following code, We could see the results ouputted at the end of code.  

```{python}
def computeBWT(s):
    s = s +'$'
    rows = sorted(s[i:] + s[:i] for i in range(len(s)))
    bwt = [row[-1:] for row in rows]
    print("".join(bwt))
    return "".join(bwt)
computeBWT('I_am_fully_convinced_that_species_are_not_immutable;_but_that_those_belonging_to_what_are_called_the_same_genera_are_lineal_descendants_of_some_other_and_generally_extinct_species,_in_the_same_manner_as_the_acknowledged_varieties_of_any_one_species_are_the_descendants_of_that_species._Furthermore,_I_am_convinced_that_natural_selection_has_been_the_most_important,_but_not_the_exclusive,_means_of_modification.')

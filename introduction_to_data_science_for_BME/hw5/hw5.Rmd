## Problem 3  

### a  

This is the probability that at most one parent have contracted influenza. So the probability either the
mother alone, the father alone, or neither parent has contracted the flu.  

### b  

Let F be the event that the father contracted cryptosporidiosis and M be the event that the mother
contracted cryptosporidiosis. Using this notation, we are given P($F \cup  M$) = 0.21, P($F \cap M$) = 0.05,
and P(F) = 0.09. Note that the event in which either the mother or the father has contracted
cryptosporidiosis is denoted by $F \cup M$, or equivalently, the event in which least one parent contracted
the disease. We are given P($F \cup M$) is 0.21.  


### c  


Using the same notation as in part b,  

$M \cap F^c$ = {mother contracted cryptosporidiosis, but father has not}
We know that  

P($M \cap F^c$) = P(M) - P($M \cap F$) = 0.17 - 0.05 = 0.12
